Question 1
Can you access items in a tuple? If yes, how?

Answer 1
Yes, in the same way you access items in a list, by calling on the indexed number of the item.

Question 2
How would you convert a tuple to a list? Hint: use the list() function

Answer 2
Convert a tuple to a list using the list() method. Example:
myTuple = (1, 2, 3)
myList = list(myTuple)
print myList
[1, 2, 3]

Question 3
Can the data type methods we saw in lists work on tuples?

Answer 3
No, as far as I can tell, none of the data type methods will work on tuples since tuples are immutable.

Question 4
How can we fix this operation?

(1) + (3, 4, 5, 6) so that the result is (1, 3, 4, 5, 6)

Answer 4
Add a comma after the 1, as in:
(1,) + (3, 4, 5, 6)
would result in
(1, 3, 4, 5, 6)
